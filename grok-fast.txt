User: Prompt
You are a senior software engineer and technical documentation reviewer.
Your task is to evaluate the developer onboarding and setup documentation for the provided project, focusing on correctness, completeness, and reproducibility.
The project includes:
- README.md (developer onboarding & setup guide)
- input.ts (actual project code)
Your goal is to determine whether a new developer can successfully set up and run the project by following the documentation exactly as written.
──────────────────────────────────── Your Responsibilities ────────────────────────────────────
1.Review Developer Onboarding Documentation
- Read README.md thoroughly
- Identify all setup steps, commands, configuration instructions
- Note any assumptions made by the documentation
2.Verify Documentation Against Code
- Inspect input.ts
- Check whether README.md instructions:
- Match actual code behavior
- Include all required steps
- Reference correct configuration values
- Attempt to logically reproduce the setup flow step by step
3.Identify Documentation Issues For each issue found, you MUST report:
- File name (README.md or input.ts)
- Line numbers
- Issue type:
- Missing step
- Incorrect command
- Incorrect default value
- Outdated or misleading description
- Broken setup flow
- Severity:
- Critical (setup impossible)
- High (setup works only with guesswork)
- Medium (confusing but recoverable)
- Low (minor clarity issue)
4.Produce Corrected Documentation
- Generate README_fixed.md
- The fixed version must:
- Be fully reproducible
- Include all required steps
- Use accurate defaults and commands
- Match the actual behavior of input.ts
- Do NOT invent features or tools not present in the project
5.Generate Onboarding Review Report Generate onboarding_report.json using the following structure:
{
  "summary": {
    "total_issues": 0,
    "critical": 0,
    "high": 0,
    "medium": 0,
    "low": 0
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "file": "README.md",
      "line_numbers": [12, 15],
      "issue_type": "Incorrect default configuration",
      "severity": "Critical",
      "description": "",
      "reproduction_result": "",
      "fix_explanation": ""
    }
  ]
}
6.Provide Step Reproduction Evidence
- Clearly list:
- Steps as written in README.md
- Where and why the setup fails
- What exact change makes it work
──────────────────────────────────── Strict Rules ────────────────────────────────────
 MUST DO:
- Cross-check documentation against code
- Reference exact line numbers
- Clearly explain why setup fails
- Produce a corrected README
- Keep outputs minimal, structured, and factual
MUST NOT:
- Hallucinate missing files
- Assume external tooling not mentioned
- Skip reproduction steps
- Invent undocumented configuration
- Rewrite code unless explicitly required

### Step Reproduction Evidence

**Steps as written in README.md:**
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the service: `npm start`
3. Use configuration as described (retryCount range 0–10, default 1, example with 0)

**Where and why the setup fails:**
- Step 1 fails immediately: `npm install` errors with "Could not read package.json: ENOENT" because no package.json file exists in the project.
- Step 2 would fail similarly: `npm start` requires scripts in package.json, which is absent.
- Even if package.json existed, the configuration details are incorrect (range 0–10 vs. code's 1–5, default 1 vs. 3, invalid example), leading to runtime errors like "retryCount must be between 1 and 5" when following the example.

**What exact change makes it work:**
- Replace npm-based setup with direct TypeScript module usage instructions.
- Correct range to 1–5, default to 3, and example to valid value with import. This allows importing and calling `startService` without build tools, matching the code's behavior.
