    {
      "id": 1,
      "file": "README.md",
      "line_numbers": [5, 6],
      "issue_type": "Missing step / Incorrect command",
      "severity": "Critical",
      "description": "Documentation instructs to run `npm install` but the repository contains no `package.json` or dependency list; `npm start` is referenced but no `start` script exists.",
      "reproduction_result": "Following the instructions as-written: `npm install` is a no-op (creates node_modules only if package.json exists); `npm start` fails because there is no package.json/start script.",
      "fix_explanation": "Either include a project `package.json` with an appropriate `start` script, or update README to provide explicit, reproducible commands (examples provided in `README_fixed.md`)."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "file": "README.md",
      "line_numbers": [8, 9],
      "issue_type": "Broken setup flow (no entrypoint)",
      "severity": "Critical",
      "description": "README says 'Run the service' but `input.ts` only exports `startService` and contains no top-level invocation or CLI — running the repository will not start anything.",
      "reproduction_result": "Even after installing tools, executing the TypeScript file does not produce output because there is no code that calls `startService`.",
      "fix_explanation": "Document that the function must be invoked (provide a `run.ts` example) or add an entrypoint to the code. The fixed README supplies a reproducible runner and commands." 
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "file": "README.md",
      "line_numbers": [13, 15],
      "issue_type": "Incorrect default value",
      "severity": "High",
      "description": "README states default `retryCount` is 1 but the code uses `config.retryCount ?? 3` (default 3).",
      "reproduction_result": "Calling `startService({})` prints `Service started with retryCount=3`, contradicting the documented default of 1.",
      "fix_explanation": "Update README to state the default is 3 (done in `README_fixed.md`). If the intended default is actually 1, update the code instead (not done here)."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "file": "README.md",
      "line_numbers": [14, 14],
      "issue_type": "Incorrect configuration range",
      "severity": "Critical",
      "description": "README documents `retryCount` range as 0–10, but `input.ts` enforces 1–5 and throws for values outside that range.",
      "reproduction_result": "Examples or configuration values within 6–10 or 0 will cause `startService` to throw: `Error: retryCount must be between 1 and 5`.",
      "fix_explanation": "Correct the documented range to 1–5 to match the implementation (or change the code to match the documented range). The README_fixed.md aligns docs with the code." 
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "file": "README.md",
      "line_numbers": [17, 19],
      "issue_type": "Outdated or misleading example",
      "severity": "Critical",
      "description": "Example shows `startService({ retryCount: 0 })` which is outside the code's allowed range and will throw at runtime.",
      "reproduction_result": "Following the example results in an exception: `Error: retryCount must be between 1 and 5`.",
      "fix_explanation": "Replace the example with valid examples and show the error case explicitly (fixed README includes both valid and invalid examples and expected output/error)."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "file": "README.md",
      "line_numbers": [3, 9],
      "issue_type": "Missing prerequisite information",
      "severity": "High",
      "description": "README omits required prerequisites (Node/npm, TypeScript or ts-node) and does not explain how to run the TypeScript module.",
      "reproduction_result": "A new developer may attempt `node input.ts` and see a syntax error; they will not know to install `ts-node` or compile first.",
      "fix_explanation": "Add explicit prerequisites and direct commands for running the TypeScript source (added to README_fixed.md)."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "file": "README.md",
      "line_numbers": [17, 19],
      "issue_type": "Minor clarity / formatting",
      "severity": "Low",
      "description": "Example snippet is not labelled as runnable and is missing a trailing semicolon; could be clearer about where to place the code (module vs. runner).",
      "reproduction_result": "No functional break, but may confuse new developers about how to execute the snippet.",
      "fix_explanation": "Clarify runnable examples and add a small runner example (done in README_fixed.md)."
